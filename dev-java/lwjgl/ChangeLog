  -lwjgl-2.4.2-r1.ebuild, lwjgl-2.6-r1.ebuild:
  Remove 2.4 now that 2.6 has been confirmed to work better with Minecraft. I
  attempted to cross-compile the native library but it didn't work due to a
  call to "uname" so now we just build it manually instead, avoiding that and
  all the other issues.

  -lwjgl-2.4.2.ebuild, -lwjgl-2.6.ebuild, +lwjgl-2.4.2-r1.ebuild,
  +lwjgl-2.6-r1.ebuild:
  The xrandr application is required at run-time, as well as libXrandr.

  +lwjgl-2.4.2.ebuild, +lwjgl-2.6.ebuild:
  Version bump and major cleanup. 2.4.2 is provided for Minecraft. Not sure
  why it takes so long to build the native part. Seems to just sit there for
  most of it. Did look at tests but they all require X or certain hardware.

  22 Jan 2009; Alistair Bush <ali_bush@gentoo.org> metadata.xml,
  lwjgl-1.0.ebuild:
  QA Fixes.
