  Add multiple instances and server-wide instances via tmux. Also optional
  hMod support but this will probably be removed before long because it is
  being superseded by Bukkit.

  22 Dec 2010; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  -minecraft-server-20101220.ebuild, +minecraft-server-20101222.ebuild:
  Version bump. I waited one day for an update but one came the next day!

  21 Dec 2010; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  +minecraft-server-20101220.ebuild, +files/mkdir.sh:
  Initial import. Packaging this separately from the game because it has no
  dependencies and the classes clash with the game's classes. Unlike the game,
  the download is the actual software itself, not just a launcher so it may
  have to be bumped fairly frequently. The version scheme isn't compatible
  with ours so I'm just using the date.
