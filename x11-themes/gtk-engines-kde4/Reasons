x11-themes/gtk-engines-kde4

Ebuild added March, 2009
Added by Mitch Harder <mitch.harder@sabayonlinux.org>

The purpose of this ebuild is to provide support for gtk apps
running in KDE 4.2.

This ebuild was brought over from Gentoo's kde-testing overlay,
and will need to be updated periodically to track changes in
that overlay.

This ebuild can be deleted from the Sabayon overlay if support 
for this package is picked up in the main Gentoo portage tree.
